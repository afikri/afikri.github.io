Back in early 2016, after finishing my master program in Computing and Innovation at The University of Adelaide, I encouraged myself to wade deep into freelancing world. My first client was a small local company run by a successful young guy. What I did was to continue unfinished work using technology a bit unfamiliar to me. I managed to learn for few weeks, and I was good to go. At first, We don't have any written contract or whatever it was, since I thought that was ok to us. Days, weeks and months passed by, my financial situation became a matter. I thought, by taking another project I still can deal with them. In fact, that was not so easy for me to manage life balance between spending time with family and staring my old creepy laptop. 

To make matters worse, I also joined in several co-founder of startup, as side job, I repeat once again, as a side job.
