title: Cyclic Rotation of Array 
tags: [array, java, algorithms]

This post is my exercise for codility test. Here is the case, we are given an array A which is zero indexed with N-length. Here is the example. Array has lengh of 5, and to be rotated 3 times. 
```
A = [3,6,4,7,8], R = 3
```
After three times of rotation, we will get
```
A3 = [4,7,8,3,6]
```
The solution can be either plucking out first three elements or rotate the array three times
